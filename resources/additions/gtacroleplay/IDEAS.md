# Ideas
---
**NOTICE: Most of these ideas are totally random and some might be unrealistic. Every time I thought of something, I just immediately threw it into this file. I never checked to see if I had already added it, so there may be duplicates or similar entries spread out and unorganized.**
---
### Businesses (some from GTA Online)
	* Nightclubs
	* Executive Offices
	* Warehouses
	* Hangars
	* Houses
	* Garages

---
### Interactive peds with each one having a background story, characteristics, certain people or groups they like/dislike.

---
* Nightclubs, bars, etc can employ "bouncer" peds that either prevent entry to certain people, or kick people out.
---
### Background ambience.
	* Anonymous city traffic and pedestrians

	* Police peds/traffic will pursue if player has 1+ stars and comes within range and line of sight.
---
### Named NPCs
	* Persistent
	* Move from place to place. Eat at restaurants, drive home, to work, get drunk at a bar, etc.
	* Different personalities
	* Relationship levels with each player and clan. If you piss them off, they won't do business with you.

### Firefighter Job
    * Vehicles catch on fire instead of blowing up.
    * Random property fires can occur.
    * Firetrucks can "spray" a fire, lowering the damage until it is extinguished (Aim detection).
---
### Streetsweeper Job
    * Instead of checkpoints, show actual messes on the road.
    * Drive over the messes with the right vehicle to "clean" the mess.
    * Only show messes if at least one player is on duty.
---
### Garbageman Job
    * Instead of checkpoints, have trashbag objects outside of properties or wherever.
    * Allow the trashtruck drivers to "pickup" the trashbag, then "place" into the truck.
    * If the truck is full, deliver the trashbags to the dump.
    * Only show trashbags if at least one player is currently doing the job.

    * Use a white solid van (Pony maybe) as a mail van.
    * Load mail at the post office, and drive a specific route to "deliver" mail.

    * Universal command to tow/release a vehicle ( /tow ).
    * Attach to nearest vehicle.
---
### Item System
    * Several item types, including armour, skins, weapons, drugs, materials, and more.
    * Items can be dropped and picked up.

### Drug houses and weed farms.
	* Make weed only plantable in certain areas.
	* Drug houses aren't limited to the type of house, as anybody can deal or use in any place.
---
### Size-based inventories.
	* Items should have a size and inventories can only hold so much.
	* Items inside of items. This could be (but not limited to):
		* Briefcases
		* Wallets
		* Safes
		* Trashbags

	* Can be cleaned up by anybody (including the murderer or suspects)
	* Showering or swimming clears blood from body

---
### Interactive Actions
	* Hotwiring a car could be successful or could also fail, depending on vehicle type and variance.

	* Require certain tools to perform different actions.
	* Different vehicles have different wires to use to be successful.

	* Cleaning weapons improves reliability
---
### Weapon Identification
	* Weapons have identifying parts like barrel bores (for ballistics) and serial numbers.
	* Serial numbers can be removed.
---
### Police Behavior
	* Stars
		* 1 star for an initial misdemeanor. Traffic violation, pedestrian crime, etc. Police will pursue to fine/ticket.
		* 2 stars for any subsequent crimes committed in police presence, after receiving one star and no action taken (if you don't pull over, run on foot, etc). Results in arrest.
		* 3 stars is basically a warrant. Police will attempt to arrest you on sight and may use heavier force than normal if you become a threat.
		* 4 stars is SWAT and/or air support backup callout. Police presence will become more dense and they will really pursue you now.
		* 5 stars (highest in the server) is all out manhunt. Police everywhere. They will most likely shoot to kill.
	* NPC police will chase you if you have 1+ stars. If you lose them with 2 or less stars, they go away unless you are sighted by another officer before cooldown.
	* Any traffic violation that takes place within LOS and range of police will cause them to chase you until you pull over.
		* Failure to pull over within a timely manner, or breaking another law before pulling over adds a second star. They won't fine you at this level, only arrest or worse.
	```
	Player police officers can issue an APB for a player suspect. NPC police drive and walk around as normal in the game but if they spot the player suspect within a certain distance and line of sight, their position is sent to any player police officers via radio and shown as a blip on the radar. If the suspect evades the NPC police, the blip fades out at the last seen suspect location and eventually disappears, no longer available to player police officers. This means that the blip will continue to show other officers at the suspect's updated location until a) all police officers lose line of sight, b) suspect gets too far away or c) enters a house/business (losing line of sight with police unless they enter). All of these will cause the blip to show the suspects last known and seen location while the blip fades out and eventually disappears. Any officer that re-establishes line of sight within a certain distance will cause the suspect's blip to show again for all police. NPC police will NOT use the built-in wanted level system because this causes excessive spawning of police no matter where the suspect is generally completely unfair. Instead, scripting functions like ped.runTo, vehicle.setCarMission, vehicle.setCruiseSpeed, etc will be used to pursue the suspect. The logic in these functions is not perfect. The NPC officer can wreck the police car, get slowed down by traffic or stuck on something altogether, and the ped can be evaded by continously going around corners and such. All of this provides the ability for the suspect to have a chance of getting away. Changing skin/clothes or driving different/unknown vehicles reduces the NPC's line of sight and distance checking and thus reduces their chance of identifying them when near

### Multi-command one-liners
Obviously this would still be using slashes for commands still. The way this works is simple: Every command returns a value `{RETURN}`, and provides indexed numerical references to it's args that can be *piped* to another command `{1}`, `{2}`, etc. For example, the /tempveh command adds a vehicle and provides both a reference to the vehicle itself (`{RETURN}`) and a reference to it's only argument (`{1}`). Some commands already implement a final, optional command to override the default chosen entity to act on (for example, `/bizname Some Business 3` will set business ID 3's name instead of the closest business to the player. Only works for staff with the manageBusinesses permission or if the player using it owns or is in the clan that owns business ID 3 and has the ability to set it's name. So this: `/tempveh infernus | /vehrgb 0 0 0 0 {RETURN} | /vehrgb 1 {2} {3} {4} {RETURN}` Would spawn a temporary infernus and immediately set both colours as completely black RGB values.
