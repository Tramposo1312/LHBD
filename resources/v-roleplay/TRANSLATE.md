# Translating

## Want to provide a translation?
### **Here's some info about how it works:**
* You can submit a pull request with your changes.

* There's no rush. You can translate at your own pace, and you don't need to translate it all right away. There's no errors or anything *"missing"* from an incomplete translation. Anything that you haven't been able to translated yet will show up as English.

* You can move around the {1}, {2}, etc but **please don't delete them**. The server replaces these in real-time with info from the script. These are usually commands or names of things (like vehicle or player names).

* Each line has two parts: key and text. Example: `"ActionTipsToggle": "Action tips are now {1}"`. The "ActionTipsToggle" is the key which the script uses to find the text it needs (the second part of the line) when showing it to the player. **Please do not translate the key names**

* All new strings will be added to the bottom of the file, including any that previously translated but were changed (usually for bug fix or if a server mechanic gets changed). This makes it easy to find the latest stuff that needs translated. Updated grouped translations will also be moved to the bottom, but may contain previously translated texts inside.

* The first two texts aren't translated. They just provide a reference to the name and author(s) of the translation.

* Some strings say DO NOT TRANSLATE ... these are just comment lines. JSON doesn't have a comment system so I had to resort to this method. They're usually to separate new sections when I add a bunch of strings in bulk. Most of them will have a date for when it was addded. As the name says, please don't translate these.
