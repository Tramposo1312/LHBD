# Ideas

**NOTICE: Most of these ideas are totally random and some might be unrealistic. Every time I thought of something, I just immediately threw it into this file. I never checked to see if I had already added it, so there may be duplicates or similar entries spread out and unorganized.**

---
### Size-based inventories.

---
### Injuries
*Inspiration from some old game that dealt with this stuff, can't remember which one*

	* Depending on type of injuries, have multiple results occur over time.
	* Gunshots lead to bleeding which could lead to passing out for loss of blood.
	* Post-treatment effects are also possible including siezures from blunt force trauma.
---
### Interactive Actions
*Inspiration from GTA Chinatown Wars and Among Us*

	* Hotwiring a car could be successful or could also fail, depending on vehicle type and variance.
	* The user has to go through each step in order to complete the task.
	* Hotwiring could have things like splitting and joining wires to make the car start or the alarm stop.
	* Include medical procedures in this idea. Surgeries, gunshot wounds, etc
	* Require certain tools to perform different actions.
	* Different vehicles have different wires to use to be successful.
---
### Limit weapons per person.

	* Vehicle sink or explode while inside the back causes death and objects destroyed.
	* Also for airplane interiors
---
### Impound Lot
*Inspiration from some SA-MP server I played on long ago*

	* Multi space impound lot. When retrieving a car from impound, spawn it in the first empty space that isn't obstructed.
---
### Weapon Wear and Tear
*Inspiration from DayZ*

	* Weapons obtain damage from use and time. If not cared for, they can have decreased damage from shots, or even break or malfunction
	* Cleaning weapons improves reliability
---
### Weapon Identification
*Inspiration from forensics system I made for a SA-MP server long ago*

	* Weapons have identifying parts like barrel bores (for ballistics) and serial numbers.
	* Serial numbers can be removed.
---
### Police Behavior
*Inspiration from cops in newer GTA games and an idea to mesh that with player cops working with them*

	* Stars
		* 1 star for an initial misdemeanor. Traffic violation, pedestrian crime, etc. Police will pursue to fine/ticket.
		* 2 stars for any subsequent crimes committed in police presence, after receiving one star and no action taken (if you don't pull over, run on foot, etc). Results in arrest.
		* 3 stars is basically a warrant. Police will attempt to arrest you on sight and may use heavier force than normal if you become a threat.
		* 4 stars is SWAT and/or air support backup callout. Police presence will become more dense and they will really pursue you now.
		* 5 stars (highest in the server) is all out manhunt. Police everywhere. They will most likely shoot to kill.
	* NPC police will chase you if you have 1+ stars. If you lose them with 2 or less stars, they go away unless you are sighted by another officer before cooldown.
	* Any traffic violation that takes place within LOS and range of police will cause them to chase you until you pull over.
		* Failure to pull over within a timely manner, or breaking another law before pulling over adds a second star. They won't fine you at this level, only arrest or worse.

```
Player police officers can issue an APB for a player suspect. NPC police drive and walk around as normal in the game but if they spot the player suspect within a certain distance and line of sight, their position is sent to any player police officers via radio and shown as a blip on the radar. If the suspect evades the NPC police, the blip fades out at the last seen suspect location and eventually disappears, no longer available to player police officers. This means that the blip will continue to show other officers at the suspect's updated location until a) all police officers lose line of sight, b) suspect gets too far away or c) enters a house/business (losing line of sight with police unless they enter). All of these will cause the blip to show the suspects last known and seen location while the blip fades out and eventually disappears. Any officer that re-establishes line of sight within a certain distance will cause the suspect's blip to show again for all police. NPC police will NOT use the built-in wanted level system because this causes excessive spawning of police no matter where the suspect is generally completely unfair. Instead, scripting functions like ped.runTo, vehicle.setCarMission, vehicle.setCruiseSpeed, etc will be used to pursue the suspect. The logic in these functions is not perfect. The NPC officer can wreck the police car, get slowed down by traffic or stuck on something altogether, and the ped can be evaded by continously going around corners and such. All of this provides the ability for the suspect to have a chance of getting away. Changing skin/clothes or driving different/unknown vehicles reduces the NPC's line of sight and distance checking and thus reduces their chance of identifying them when near

	* Use a 3D primitive on the spot thats pointed to.
	* Use pointing (finger?) animation if available
---
### Multi-command one-liners

```
Obviously this would still be using slashes for commands still. The way this works is simple: Every command returns a value {RETURN}, and provides indexed numerical references to it's args that can be piped to another command {1}, {2}, etc. For example, the /tempveh command adds a vehicle and provides both a reference to the vehicle itself (`{RETURN}`) and a reference to it's only argument (`{1}`). Some commands already implement a final, optional command to override the default chosen entity to act on (for example, `/bizname Some Business 3` will set business ID 3's name instead of the closest business to the player. Only works for staff with the ManageBusinesses permission or if the player using it owns or is in the clan that owns business ID 3 and has the ability to set it's name.

So this:
/tempveh infernus | /vehrgb 1 0 0 0 {RETURN} | /vehrgb 2 {2} {3} {4} {RETURN}`

Would spawn a temporary infernus and immediately set both colours as completely black RGB values.
```

---
### Animation/emote, action, and message menu wheels
So with new Steam Deck being available now, and all the other attempts to use mobile devices that either emulate or stream the older GTA PC games, I figure we'd need a way for players to interact with each other using them. Roleplay is usually a very chat-oriented gamemode, but I can probably make things easier with simple controls. Also customizable messages, animations, and actions for each menu/wheel slot
The inventory system is already planned to use a hotbar/wheel but I don't have all the images for it yet
---
### Fishing
    * Fishing works near water or on a boat (I have a way to detect both)
    * Use the bat swing anim for casting line, and the crouch anim for applying bait.
    * Bait is used same as ammo item for a weapon. Hold the fishing rod, make sure bait is in inventory, and press use (default U) to apply bait.
    * Use a "press and hold" key to cast a line to a custom distance. Show progress bar to indicate how far the line will be cast.
    * Place a single-use particle effect on the water (distance to front of player) to show where the casted line hits.
    * Use particle effects (water spray or splash effect) to display a fish being hooked.
    * Slowly move the particle effect to the player to show it being reeled in as the player holds the reel key.
    * Random selection of predefined catch items, both junk and fish.
    * Player would be wise to bring a bucket or crate to keep the fish in, using existing /take and /put system like any other item.
	**This will need extra stuff added to keybinds system for duration key holding**
---
### Compass
*Inspiration from Hell Let Loose and the 3D Fallout games*

An indicator at the bottom, showing compass direction and a dot or something in the direction of the GPS location. Like an object marker.
In-world indicator too, when player gets close and is in line of sight
---
### Item/Object pickup and move
*Inspiration from the 3D Fallout games*

Fallout 3 and New Vegas have a neat feature where you can "grab" an object and fling it around while the key is pressed. Could be implemented for items in GTACRP servers
